Does the phrase "A masked figure performs ritualistic acts in a﻿ mystery play" have anything to do with this? Its from sabian astrology. I found it by calculating 666° - 360° = 306°. This is 6° Aquarius (11th house, 300°). Both 306 & 666 yeilds a "negation" of the Golden Ratio (Phi) of creation. Calculate 2*sin(x), where x is 666 or 306. 306 relates also to the pentagram with 2 points up, the demonic orientation. The second symbol of Aquarius is a bird which is on the guys shoulder here.

Without a doubt﻿ this is a second Loughner account, and that is probably him in the video. It is the same type of illogical syllogisms that are on the Loughner videos. Burning the flag is illegal and he didn't want to be arrested before the assassination attempt.

Hope he gets put away in a mental asylum where he belongs, and isn't murdered.

The manner in which the trash bag is used could be indicative that he is apperceptive to his environment,being careful not to leave the slightest sign of his presence. The﻿ effort to conceal his face, to me, also indicates a discernment of what is right and wrong. And of course, in incinerating The Flag, he is attempting to communicate a message to others. He suffers from some mental condition,but I think he is sane enough to stand trial and be held accountable.

Uhhh, looks like you missed the point, pal. Also, mind citing a source on the whole "You will have it or go to jail" thing? Cause this lie, perpetrated by (who else) but Glenn﻿ Beck, was proven false, and Fox News not only retracted it later on, but claimed they never said it. Even though the clip of it is widely available on youtube. (It may have been hannity, tbf, same douche, different haircut)

--
AceofSpad3sking1994 (in reply to MentosMan727 1 year ago):
How about you read the bill before you say that﻿ I'm lieing.
The bill specificly states that if you don't have healthcare then you face either a 10,000 dollar fine or a 90 day prison sentence.( Excluding those who have an income no greater than 8,000 dollars.)
As for Glenn Beck I think that he's a lieing coniving peice of trash that shouldn't even be on the air. He only has a show to satisfy the Republican viewers.
Also, maybe you should site a source as to who proved it false?

--
MentosMan727 (in reply to AceofSpad3sking1994 1 year ago):
Wrong. I don't need to "cite" a source, as you're the one making the claim. The bill is very long, and I am not going to read it all for the purpose of disproving someone even the most conservative pundits have admitted is wrong. In fact, a google search of the terms "jail+healthcare+bill" only seems to bring up some Pelosi comments from 2009. Since you're the one who has READ IT ALL and is very concerned, mind pointing me to﻿ a specific section of the bill?

--
MentosMan727 (in reply to AceofSpad3sking1994 1 year ago):
If this were the case, it'd be very disturbing. It would be something, had I of read it, I'd know exactly where it was, not just repeat what I heard on Fox News. For instance, I can recite the sections of the Patriot Act that are the most disturbing. Surely you can do the same for the Healthcare Bill?
Of course you can't. You never read it. You either made that up, or repeated what you heard, which has since been retracted by.... well, everyone. Except you :p﻿

--
MentosMan727 (in reply to AceofSpad3sking1994 1 year ago):
Upon further investigation, the House passed a bill which would allow jailing people who failed to pay the taxes levied against them for evading insurance.

The bill that was signed into law contains no such clause.﻿ I would link you, but that's hard to do thanks to all the spamming dicks ruining it for everyone. Sorry man.

robertmike57 (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
doesn't matter what politics﻿ Loughner was. Sarah Palin was advocating the murder of Gifffords , no reason for her to leave her map up past november 2nd except to eliminate Giffords & Nick Rahall. But we know conservatives love murdering people when they lose elections.

--
HaIoedG (in reply to robertmike57 1 year ago):
Wrong again. You want it to be Palin's fault just like Obama wants all his failed policies to be Bush's fault. This is why we "teabaggers" are always preach personal﻿ responsibility. At some point you folks on the left are gonna have to quit blaming and get your acts together.

Schizophrenic? What does this have to do with schizophrenia?﻿ Schizophrenia is not a synonym for crazy.

--
leskop (in reply to MsNeoDraven 1 year ago):
it is actually, look it up on thesaurus. Loughner displays many symptoms of classic schizophrenia. Not every schizophrenic is necessarily "crazy" but the overlap of the two definitely exists.﻿

--
MsNeoDraven (in reply to leskop 1 year ago):
Thesaurus is not accurate. Schizophrenia is when people cant﻿ tell the difference between reality. They have a mental Illness and was born that way or their environment made them sensitive. If he showed Early Schizophrenia signs why is he being diagnosed now? Its too late. It doesn't matter. Crazy is such a negative word to describe people with a real problem. Why don't people give as much support to homicidal people as suicidal?

--
leskop (in reply to MsNeoDraven 1 year ago):
Because he didn't specifically make public threats against anyone. You can't arrest people for thoughts that they haven't publicly expressed. Even if they have, it's very difficult﻿ to institutionalize someone against their will. It's a big part of the problem. Even if you know someone may be potentially homicidal and you tell the police, their parents, their friends, you still can't necessarily do anything about it. A person over 18 cannot be detained without a specific crime.

--
MsNeoDraven (in reply to leskop 1 year ago):
Thats what mental hospitals are for you can't just throw someone in jail because you fear they are a harm to other people. It's very hard to hide mental illness. I have dealt with mental disorders all of my life and have seen people iller than me. You can do something about it there are medications﻿ and intensive therapy to help people like that because I have ran into them before in hospitals it doesn't matter what age you are.

--
leskop (in reply to MsNeoDraven 1 year ago):
You also cannot throw someone in a mental hospital if they have not committed a crime or done something outlandish enough beforehand. He hadn't committed any actual crime yet. If I though you were crazy, without you acting out some crime, I can't tell people to just come and take you away. Yes he could have﻿ gotten help, but if he doesn't take the initiative, you cannot force him into a hospital, get therapy, or get him on medications based on his youtube vids. Law doesn't allow it

--
MsNeoDraven (in reply to leskop 1 year ago):
You don't need to do a crime or do something crazy to go to the hospital. I went and I wasn't suicidal or "crazy". My meds weren't treating my disorder and I needed outside help. There is always someone coming on the news﻿ talking about the signs someone showed after they already did it. If you knew the signs before hand why not help that person get evaluated? You're right you cant force someone. Thats not Jareds Youtube because the person is still posting this is a gimmick.

--
leskop (in reply to MsNeoDraven 1 year ago):
I'm pretty sure we're actually on the same page, I'm an advocate for people with mental illness to get treatment, and I have had many people around me affected by that, even suicidal people that have killed themselves. Unless you have undisputed proof that some person is nuts though, you can't do anything about it. Even if you have proof, you still may not be able to do anything about it. Mental illness is just not taken very seriously, and it's a problem, as we﻿ have seen.

--
HaIoedG (in reply to leskop 1 year ago):
AZ has a statewide hotline for ANYONE to report someone that is suspected of having a mental disorder, regardless of criminal activity or just general concern for one's well being. Neither the sheriff nor college staff ever reported him even though they had﻿ numerous reasons to do so.

--

really? I had no idea. I'll have to﻿ check it. It's a shame more people couldn't take advantage of this, especially if such a thing is available. It makes me kind of vomit in my mouth a little bit, maybe a lot. Why isn't there more public awareness about it? That seems key

Let’s pull out a dictionary here and let’s look at the words Arguing and Discussion. Arguing: –verb (used with object)
3. to state the reasons for or against: The lawyers argued the case.
4. to maintain in reasoning: to argue that the news report must be wrong.
Now lets﻿ look at discussion
noun
an act or instance of discussing; consideration or examination by argument, comment, etc., esp. to explore solutions; informal debate.

--

You said arguing obviously out of frustration, I said discussion not out of frustration but the desire to work toward a solution.

Palin, a Tea Bagger spokesperson, had all the gun references we've all seen/heard + The Congresswomen was concerned =Then got shot. How simple is it to﻿ connects the dots? Loughner is only as crazy as his "mental acts". Gun goonery from little penile people who view the government, and it representatives in paranoid conspiratorial ways. The mental acts are libertarian, repackaged as now as Tea Party. Watch "Zeitgeist: The Movie" for insight. Add drugs will make anyone crazy.

Nope, according to﻿ everyone that knew him he didn't watch news or listen to talk radio and he was a registered Independent. I see you've worked in that Giffords was concerned. If that's the case then why didn't she have ANY security? You're a nut that WANTS to believe something other than facts.

@HaIoedG
No witness has reported seeing the entire incident between the time the shooting started and the time Loughner was subdued. Virtually all of the witnesses reported they didn't see any shooting, they only heard it. The ones who saw it either took bullets or hit the pavement and played dead﻿ or both. Loughner was subdued 40 feet south of Giffords, witnesses reported the shooter fled the scene PAST Walgreens, over 100 feet north of Giffords. Loughner is a patsy.

--
fertilizerspike (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
@HaIoedG
He pointed a camera﻿ at somebody and said "you're dead", it's laughable that the police were even involved, given this man had just been shot days before in the cross-fire of a political assassination.

--
HaIoedG (in reply to fertilizerspike 1 year ago):
Eric﻿ Fuller

--
fertilizerspike (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
@HaIoedG
Sure, here's part of Fuller's statements:
"a very, seemed like athletic young man pumping rounds off"
Loughner is a skinny little runt, all pictures of him illustrate this, even the video he took a few months ago in the junior college, nobody would describe him as "athletic" unless they're half blind. Fuller also says he fell to the ground and it was "like a dream sequence". He has no clue who shot him, all he knows is somebody shot him, and somebody﻿ was pinned to the ground after.

--
HaIoedG (in reply to fertilizerspike 1 year ago):
To a fat ass a skinny little runt is athletic. You want a conspiracy just like 9/11, JFK the list goes on and on. Reality is to much for you to accept that's why you need delusions.﻿

--
fertilizerspike (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
@HaIoedG
The guy describing him as "athletic" is a skinny little﻿ runt himself, he's not a "fat ass", or whatever you think will get this to make sense in your head. I didn't want something like this to happen, I'd rather it be a lone nut, but the lone nut theorists are just blathering nonsense and internet gossip at this point. Maybe when you lone nut theorists get some evidence to present, you'll be taken seriously.

--
fertilizerspike (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
@HaIoedG
The man described by Fuller is Zamudio, or someone very much like him. Zamudio is a football player, he always carries a gun with him and he stated when he left the Walgreens he had the safety off and intended to kill Loughner if he'd been on the move. Zamudio's demeanor is cold and emotionless, as are his descriptions of the carnage, when those descriptions aren't tainted with his barely concealed pride at just how many people he﻿ shot and how fast, even hitting all the primary targets.

--
HaIoedG (in reply to fertilizerspike 1 year ago):
Gifford's was shot point blank( by Loughner) she was the primary target because﻿ she didn't answer his retarded question from a previous encounter the rest were people in the wrong place at the wrong time.

--
fertilizerspike (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
@HaIoedG
You must be really fucking stupid and gullible if you believe that. For one thing, no witnesses put the gun in Loughner's hand. The video evidence the FBI has, combined with witness reports of Loughner's actions on scene, show Loughner was not the shooter. Wake the fuck up, you﻿ delusional troll. If you're not going to educate yourself as to the facts of the case, stop acting like you know what happened, because you don't even have the various stories straight.

--
fertilizerspike (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
@HaIoedG
The federal judge John Roll was clearly﻿ one of the targets, he took fatal shots, so did one of Giffords' closest aides. Giffords is alive, and you say she was the target? You really are fucking stupid.

--
HaIoedG (in reply to fertilizerspike 1 year ago):
Nope, you WANT him to be, to﻿ add to your delusion. Once Giffords was down he unloaded the gun at random people.

--
fertilizerspike (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
@HaIoedG
You're the one who seems to want what's not real. Judge Roll died instantly, Giffords is alive, and you think Giffords was the primary target?﻿ You're out of your mother fucking mind. Go play in the street.

--
HaIoedG (in reply to fertilizerspike 1 year ago):
He didn't even know who Roll was, and﻿ he sure as hell didn't know he was a federal judge.

--
fertilizerspike (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
@HaIoedG
And the evidence shows﻿ he wasn't the shooter so what's your point? You didn't know who judge Roll was, either, does that mean YOU shot all those people? Get a fucking life, moron, and learn to fucking read, go find out what happened, it's all in print, go read, come back when you figure out where you went wrong.

--
HaIoedG (in reply to fertilizerspike 1 year ago):
Yes it does, you want another conspiracy. but you can't﻿ have one.

--
fertilizerspike (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):

--
brets321 (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
I was taught the same. The field is removed first, then﻿ you separate the stripes. The disposal method, Once trisected, the flag is non existent. I was taught was that you cremate the field, red stripes and white stripes, in three separate fires.
I still see the whole flag incinerated by veterans groups, boy scouts, etc., as a means of disposal. Flag disposal etiquette varies from party to party.

James Eric﻿ Fuller was one of the 19 people that were shot in Tucson when a madmen unloaded his gun on Congress woman Giffords and many of her supporters.

Sadly the blame game has led to Fuller being arrested Saturday for shouting out death threats to a Tea Party member.

There's absolutely no way to tell who that is in the video, and really no way to know who uploaded it. Even if it's associated﻿ with an IP, anyone could have done the upload. To assume it's Loughner is highly speculative.

Government overstepping their role at ruby ridge and waco were cited in the 90's. Now government is overstepping their roles in other areas and the tea party is trying to slow government down.

HaIoedG (in reply to gonadcancervictim 1 year ago):
You're searching too hard to find blame. Ruby Ridge and Waco were perfect examples of government out of control and﻿ Oklahoma City was the price paid, but this is different. According to Jared's friends he was not into politics per-say but had far right ideals and hated the right particulary Bush because he was a 9/11 truther.

The Pima County Sheriffs Department and Jareds friends both said Jared had been contacting Gabby Giffords since a "Town Hall" event held in 2007.

I really don't give a damn what you think. The gun was passed around more than a thai hooker, the police have no chain of evidence when it comes﻿ to that gun, they have as much evidence putting it in your hand as they do Loughner's. Yes, I understand, you don't want to admit you were fooled by a magic trick sleight of hand. Don't worry, it's not you that was fooled, just the witnesses on the scene. The perpetrators clearly had a simple and effective plan to set Loughner up as the patsy

Tell me this then, since i'm just some conspiracy kook. Why was Gifford subscribed to Loughner 4 months prier to the event?? Why was this never mentioned in the media?????

Gabby had﻿ a 100% rating from NARAL, she voted for:
-Healthcare reform
-Wall Street reform
-the teacher/state worker bail-out
-the DREAM Act
-to repeal DADT
-the stimulus
-9/11 Health and Compensation Act
Her American Conservative Union life-time rating for 2009 was 14.67%. By contrast, Harry Reid got 18.56%
Loughner used to play Earth Empires, the massively multiplayer game. His posts about misogyny, rape, racism and violence toward children. Not a liberal.

Daniel is 21-years-old. Six months ago, he was doing well in college and holding down a part-time job in the stockroom of a local electronics store.

First, he became convinced that his professors were “out﻿ to get him” since they didn’t appreciate his confusing, off-topic classroom rants.

"he showed up late and grabbed the wrong guy at first"
All the people involved in this shooting were following a script but﻿ also improvising to a certain extent, the two holding down the patsy were making a lot of noise about Loughner, planting the suggestion he was the shooter, the real shooter showed up and took the gun "out of play", in his words.

@LetsGoFlyers2011
The wounded may have been preped for a "staged" shooting where nobody would﻿ be hurt, Zamudio claimed shot people were saying "this is real this is real where are the ambulances". Very quiet time of day for the parking lot there, few witnesses outside the line of victims, accomplices and the shooter stayed on scene to control the scene and plant suggestions in the traumatized victims minds. The evidence supports this, many weird statements by Zamudio about him controlling scene.

I don't plan to do anything about it, and if I'd been thinking I wouldn't have mentioned it at all, I don't want to be their next target. But I'm not backing down from the claim, I believe it. Zamudio is most likely suspect, most likely accomplices are Salzgeber and the cab driver. Also possible "Bill Badger" and the Maisch woman. Badger and the woman were on either side of﻿ Loughner in line. Salzgeber made death threats to Loughner with a gun in his hand and tried choking him.

This is what Zamudio says:
"They can bring it across the border from Mexico, you can get an old one that's not registered, you can steal one, you can buy it out of a trunk."
He apparently knows lots of ways to get guns illegally. Maybe Jared sold it to him. Maybe he hired a hooker to seduce Jared and get him to wave his gun around wearing a g﻿ string so she could photograph it and switched it with another gun.

Zamudio says he was ready to kill Loughner when he exited the Walgreens, he took the safety off his gun. He said if Loughner had been running instead of being held down he would have killed him. If Loughner were only running how﻿ would he know to kill him? Does he kill everyone he sees running after hearing gunshots? Zamudio blazed those people, then ran around the Walgreens and came back to control the scene. He had accomplices there holding Loughner and keeping him from talking.

Exactly, that's Zamudio's story. No witness reports saying that to him, but Zamudio claims "everyone" said it.

You never know, if you say otherwise they might come after you next, so whatever. Enjoy life.

--
fertilizerspike (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
@HaIoedG
Zamudio is the only one who did any actual killing there, most likely. "Bill Badger" is a former army colonel, army colonels coordinate troops﻿ on the ground in battle, and he's from the WWII/Korea era, definitely no stranger to killing then. The woman is a former army nurse and Salzgeber apparently moved to the area from Chicago in the 80's and makes money from a nursury selling plants, I don't know more about him, he's very private and very wealthy.

What's even more﻿ absurd is you seem to think these three elderly people had no problem subduing an armed gunman who'd just mowed down 20 people but you think it's ludicrous they would be capable of setting up a murder, hiring a shooter and setting up the patsy. It'd be a lot easier to take down Loughner if he was a pussy being set up as a patsy than if he were a real ruthless killer. Zamudio is the ruthless one, he's the cold emotionless one, watch his interviews.

fertilizerspike (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
@HaIoedG
That's Zamudio's story, he also says Salzgeber, who had the gun, was telling Loughner "I'll kill you" and waving the gun around. The police later said that gun was inoperable due to a spring malfunction. Only Zamudio reports anyone saying "wrong guy", no witness reports saying that to him. Zamudio﻿ says he made Salzgeber drop the gun and told him to step on it to "keep us all safe" and take the gun "out of play". The police report the gun "somewhere in the crowd", no chain of evidence.

--
fertilizerspike (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
@HaIoedG
And you seem to be suggesting I've fallen for some nebulous plot by Loughner to cloud my mind with something unspecified in order to convince me he's guilty. You think a team of trained killers pulling off a professional attack on an unarmed population is implausible yet you seem to think Loughner is somehow capable of inspiring devotion and turning people into mindless﻿ minions parroting his defense strategy.

--
fertilizerspike (in reply to LetsGoFlyers2011 1 year ago):
@LetsGoFlyers2011
Salzgeber's testimony is the only one that conflicts wildly with the others, Zamudio told on day 1 that Salzgeber said "I'll kill you" to Loughner while waving the gun around. Unsure why he was doing it, Zamudio put the gun forcibly on the ground and told Salzgeber﻿ to step on it to "put it out of play". Zamudio then claimed he only went for the gun because he didn't realize that one of the three people holding Loughner down wasn't the shooter. Salzgeber was grandstanding.

--
fertilizerspike (in reply to LetsGoFlyers2011 1 year ago):
@LetsGoFlyers2011
Salzgeber now won't talk to the media about what happened, and will only say that other people are the heroes. Zamudio has gone on a media tour telling his version of the events. This was all done with simple﻿ misdirection and trauma based mind control. These people were all horrified by Zamudio's rampage, when he arrived moments later nobody left alive recognized him as the shooter.

the classitup videos are his manifesto the world to see after the shootings. he made them knowing his plan to assassinate giffords.﻿ I think he thought it would be more clear than it is but he's so schizo he didn't realize nobody would figure out it wasn't random nonsensical nonsense. but go back and watch them with that mindset. he announces who he is. he announces what he does and why he does. he defends himself from the label of terrorist. those were his last words to the world.

One thing that seems to escape everyone's notice is that whoever is in this video is properly destroying a damaged flag.

Why did he make it clear the flag was damaged?﻿ Is this person a soldier? Is his conscience (dreaming?) forcing him to make it clear he's not desecrating a flag but properly burning a damaged flag?

Are you totally unaware that burning a flag is the only legal way to retire it? You're not allowed to throw it into﻿ a landfill if you want to be right with god and the US military. This soldier is doing it the way he was taught to do it, make sure everyone watching sees the flag is damaged, then stand at attention for a short time while it burns. All very respectful, all very conditioned, this is how a soldier burns a flag.

HaIoedG (in reply to fertilizerspike 1 year ago):
Retard. This nut is not a soldier(2) This flag is not worn﻿ enough to be legally decommissioned(3) there is a ceremony that has to be performed, they don't just set it on fire.

--
fertilizerspike (in reply to NotADood 1 year ago):
@NotADood
Not only is flag burning legal, it's the only way to properly destroy a flag. Soldiers do it routinely when they retire damaged flags. That's what the soldier in this video did, he showed for quite a long time that the flag's stripes were coming﻿ apart, this was a retired flag that a soldier burned. Probably the same soldier carrying a concealed weapon who ran past the Walgreens after shooting everyone. The same soldier in a black hoodie who was later called a hero by the media.

But something is odd about his

--
Nukefuzion (in reply to mattlambrecht1 1 year ago):
Perhaps you know what he read. Perhaps he interpreted those ideas in a, deranged manner. Perhaps all of his thoughts had a convoluted sense of reality. Perhaps, probably, likely, yes. I'd be content with your reason also though. I would think the books﻿ he read may have contributed to his, ahem dilemma. Have you ever seen the ideas people come up? People "quoting" John Locke. That's not John Locke, you just intentionally desecrated his words to further your own agenda!

--
mattlambrecht1 (in reply to Nukefuzion 1 year ago):
well my point about the books was that everything about him screams of the MK Ultra and alleged Project Monarch theories.. but idk.. my major point I guess is there shouldn't be a false equivalence drawn between him and "conspiracy theorists" (bad term, "CT" is just conclusions based on relatively obscure premises) who are of perfectly sound mind.. All of this political propagandization is shameless.. n yeah I see people read the wrong things into﻿ things they read, good point..

--
Nukefuzion (in reply to mattlambrecht1 1 year ago):
Compare to who? I'm just pointing out what's wrong with his thinking. There could or there could not be a fringe belief. I do not know. I do not know the full story of course. I can't rely on the media. Sure, he might be a schizophrenic, or he may have dissociative imagery, but who knows for sure? We didn't pay enough attention to him then, why not now? Oh, I don't get why people keep calling him a sick bastard. You don't know his life. I mean if he did this with full﻿ knowledge..

--
mattlambrecht1 (in reply to Nukefuzion 1 year ago):
I will admit part of the reason I'm being so adamant with you you might not have apprehended, which is totally understandable. Basically the media is portraying him﻿ to an extent as a "conspiracy theorist" who ranted about subjects such as mind control and the manipulation of currency.. These are topics I think are valid for discussion. The thing is, though, that he, for example, never once mentioned MK Ultra or the alleged Monarch program or any of that.

--
Nukefuzion (in reply to mattlambrecht1 1 year ago):
I don't think we're in disagreement. I just think that we're saying what we mean without enough clarity. There just isn't enough information to make a sound conclusion yet.

I will accept my follies however, if there is sufficient evidence, or the brandishing of my errors to myself by others.

rachelabombdotcom (in reply to ViPad2011 1 year ago):
er... that still doesn't explaing why you keep injecting it into the crime as if it is﻿ the motive. Is it possible that's why you're angry at AJ because he won't go there?
He called her a fake and currency was on his mind not Judiasm. In fact he never wrote or talked about it that I know of. You aren't teaching anyone anything. Further the only time I use wiki is when I already know the answer wiki is a joke...

--
ViPad2011 (in reply to rachelabombdotcom 1 year ago):
When someone kills an "american congresswoman"﻿ who has a jewish background then yes, it is legit to keep injecting it into a crime since it cannot be excluded from being one of the motives of Jared Lee Loughner. You think the FBI haven't thought about that aswell?

--
rachelabombdotcom (in reply to ViPad2011 1 year ago):
I think the FBI may have thought about it for :30 seconds then﻿ realized he was Jewish too and never mentioned anything about Jews so went back to the things that are actually relevant...

"I haven't given any money to AJ"
Maybe not, but you give him hits on his videos, and website and he makes money off that. You push his ideas and recruit people to go to his website, even if you don't realize that's what you're doing by parroting﻿ the things he talks about. If you know anything about advertising then you know that "word of mouth" is the best form, so he's duped people like you into prophesying his NWO conspiracy.

The truth is a never ending quest and should be for all of us. I was never into politics until my country was attacked so viciously.

"I'm a fierce independent libertarian because party politics is disgusting to me and both sides are a sham."
but yet u are defending alex who just posted an article by Paul Watson titled "Liberal Smear Machine Backfires After Gunman Found To Be Occultist, Pot-Smoking Left Winger " which play right into﻿ the right/left paradigm that you claim to be against.

Isn't that exactly what happened though or are you in seclusion from the truth completely because AJ said it?
I saw the article but I sure didn't need to read it because I'm well aware of Chris Matthews et al and how they operate. Shameless partisan hacks abound even at FAUX.﻿ I'm a scpan watcher but I will say Faux is the least of the evil MSM, but I'm under no illusions about their lies and omissions.

No, i don't think that is what happened at all. I think the guy was a paranoid schizophrenic. People like u, Alex, Fox News, ect are trying 2 paint him as a liberal & don't even care that something was obviously wrong with him. What u call "the truth" is merely ur opinion. People like u are confused. u talk against right/left politics, but then u side with the right.

Oh please... I side with the truth, that well documented﻿ tea party/Constitution loving Americans were being demonized mere minutes after the shooting by politico, NY times and CNN.

With all do respect. Fluoride? Are you serious? How about being upset that he doesn't talk about the harmful components or tobacco or alcohol. There is no reason to compare pot to fluoride. Drunk people do awful things all﻿ the time.

"Something we agree on (fluoride) but﻿ saying right-winger takes it too far."
With all due respect, but it was people on the right who started the fluoride conspiracy. It's also the people on the right who pushed the "godless communists" worldview, and that worldview is still used to portray atheists as liberal communists, and the﻿ way you view this event is still influenced by those ideas that were pushed by the right 50 or so years ago. Sorry if you think that's me "taking it to far".

With all do﻿ respect... The FDA has recently come out with reports that fluoridation of the water is harming people's teeth because so many more products have it now besides the water. You do realize that fluoride is a waste product of industrial production and a neurotoxin right? You are aware that we are importing it from China and Japan right?
You must be aware of this video right?

If Loughner's actions had been about politics, it would be more likely to have been the left who inspired it. Loughner is a self proclaimed leftist who hates Bush, Palin, and other conservatives. He has been known to call congresswoman Giffords a "fake" because of her right leaning views.
Since the left is standing with egg on their faces (stinking rotten egg), maybe they can stop showing how lowly they are﻿ and start placing the blame on Giffords where it belongs.

as skeptical as I am of any religion and prophecy and all that I dig the wisdom in that quote it speaks to our cultural plight I think "it the last days people﻿ shall be lovers of themselves and also they shall call evil good and good evil" I don't necessarily think it takes "supernatural"/divine knowledge/intervention to predict that in a degrading society, but its like a primordially deep observation of the process of order and chaos in civilization..

mattlambrecht1 (in reply to majorl31 1 year ago):
yeah well I try to be respectful even though I am skeptical of the supernatural claims of religion. I find alot of value in the wise teachings and culture though that many religions have created in certain aspects at least. Protestant culture was probably the only one that﻿ could've served as the soil for America's ideal of freedom from tyranny and the standard of religious tolerance and I find the progressive-vs-fundamental christian bickering insulting to our forefathers' intelligence

euphemus2 (in reply to 3Roymunson 1 year ago):
How many of those deaths in other countries were in self defence? That argument cuts boths ways. If there﻿ were less guns for the purpose of committing homicide, then you would expect by default to find less deaths by guns used in self-defence. The underlying notion here is that if you have less guns to start with, less guns for the purposes of homicide, suicide, self defence etc., then you will also have less gun deaths regardless of specific mode of commission.

--
mattlambrecht1 (in reply to tanzalone1 1 year ago):
It actually is﻿ but you have to extract good info because everyone propagandizes.. Whether its an otherwise great "conspiratorial" researcher who then goes on to say that the real problem is Satan or aliens.. Or its a textbook writer at my school with a good summation of international relations, but literally SPRINKLED with obvious globalist propaganda.. You have to read everything and verify and cross-reference premises in order to derive good conclusions.

--
qpwillie (in reply to tanzalone1 1 year ago):
You are making the same mistake that makes leftists what they are. The reason you're obsessed with Fox is because you think we're like the leftists in that they get their opinions from the news media or other media personalities. That's totally different from the way we form our opinions and conclusions.
Once our conclusions are formed, we do tend to listen to other people who have come to the same conclusions but﻿ it's a reflection. IOW, unlike yourself, we do our own thinking.

--
mattlambrecht1 (in reply to tanzalone1 1 year ago):
the Nazi's were a theosophical-based ideology, rooted in the concept of anthropogenesis. This is occult race﻿ metaphysics. They weren't really right or left-wing, they were "Jesuit-Illuminist" controlled/engineered, although neither of those terms accurately describes the global establishment/ "divine right" royalty, just a couple of the proxies/usual suspects. btw anyone criticizing the fox news people who simply watch MSNBC instead... LOL that's all I have to say

--
tanzalone1 (in reply to mattlambrecht1 1 year ago):
lol OK the Nazis were not right wing extremists? This coming from a person so dense as not to see that Fox is a propaganda network? At least I can admit that﻿ MSNBC is propaganda. I just love how the right wing now wants to rewrite history and make everything "evil" derrivative of the left. Face it, the left is not evil and the right is not evil but if you go to the extremes of each side you can see things become more "evil" or have negative consequences.

--
mattlambrecht1 (in reply to tanzalone1 1 year ago):
I didn't say that.. you're putting words in my mouth.. Of course they were "right-wing extremists" in the sense that they defined how we think of "extreme" right-wing ideology.. I was just trying to explain how I am convinced they were connected to﻿ an existing "occult" establishment that will use ANY means to achieve an objective, including "revolution" or "reaction". And of course Fox is dumbed down right-wing propaganda. But its not extreme, its all pro-status quo.

--
MissSovietBones (in reply to mattlambrecht1 1 year ago):
It's very rude that you used the unsophisticated phrase 'dumbed﻿ down' because no human is truly unintelligent and we all have our strengths and weaknesses. Some people on Fox News are just manipulative or misinformed, but not stupid. Where do you get your news? (Please don't assume I worship Fox News, because I don't.)

--
mattlambrecht1 (in reply to MissSovietBones 1 year ago):
well I don't﻿ mean that everyone that appears on Fox News is dumb, my point is that the media in general has a low level of analysis, too short periods of discussion to have a sufficient detail of arguments to have a thorough debate, and the main scripted stuff is written for the American demographic which in newspapers to be exact is at an average of 3rd or 4th grade reading level.. and I think our public educational institutions reflect similar deficiencies.

--
MissSovietBones (in reply to mattlambrecht1 1 year ago):
I really appreciate that you responded maturely and I don't mean this at all in a patronizing way since I've come to expect very mean spirited responses from those with differing opinions on Youtube. I must say that I do agree with you rpoignant analysis﻿ of Fox News and I believe it to be the way it is not due to the incapability of producing higher quality news, but because it's founded by corporations who want to blanket and deflect from the full truth. This is a shame and why

--
mattlambrecht1 (in reply to MissSovietBones 1 year ago):
Yeah I think people are quick to be very harsh and rude on youtube because it is so impersonal. but I think things like this Loughner kid might even be in some ways an example of how that detachment from consequence could possibly translate into actual behavior during real social and physical interaction. imagine if our children were to grow up learning conversation from﻿ the way we "discuss" things on youtube.. its a scary thought

--
MissSovietBones (in reply to mattlambrecht1 1 year ago):
I try 2 retrieve my news from the internet. Of course even the internet﻿ is tainted with biased research+ hidden motives. The process is very frustrating, but rewarding once you find somewhere you can trust. I also respect your views on intelligence+ I'm sorry if I sounded very agitated. I don't believe we should encourage anti-intellectual attitudes, but rather a relativist approach 2 different forms of intelligence. At the same time, ignorance should be educated versus insulted.

--
mattlambrecht1 (in reply to MissSovietBones 1 year ago):
Yeah. And I agree about the internet, as long as you know how to cross-reference differing opinions.. I read alot of stuff that might be considered "fringe" including Christians researchers with a very adamantly religious worldview.. but I've found there are some mainstream attitudes which reject entire bodies of work by people like that just because they disagree with a part of their conclusions, and so they disregard a wealth of﻿ potentially relevant information.

--
mattlambrecht1 (in reply to MissSovietBones 1 year ago):
I agree though I think most people are of a similar intelligence and that in many ways this is even subjective because intelligence is not always quantifiable as it has many different expressions and is a complex construct of differing capacities. I think some of﻿ the processes of our society have become insulting to our level of intelligent evolution as human beings and our culture in many ways encourage a peculiar kind of anti-intellectualism and a general lack of integrity in varying respects.

--
mattlambrecht1 (in reply to tanzalone1 1 year ago):
I admit that was my fault though, I said not "really" right or left-wing.... I mean yeah they were right-wing, but its just not the same as the "right-wing" today. The idea that the Jews are a metaphysically inferior race, etc. has nothing to do with things such American Republicanism, Libertarianism, etc. What I'm saying is the top-Nazi's were﻿ more like bizarre cultists than American rednecks lol

--
mattlambrecht1 (in reply to tanzalone1 1 year ago):
I disagree though, the "evil" is clearly in the establishment and status quo. although it is also on the extreme right and extreme left, but I think you should ask "who created the extreme right and left ideologies and what purpose do they serve?". The extreme left is socialism/communism right? The Bolshevist Revolution was funded by US bankers agents﻿ of JP Morgan, if you study these people its completely clear why this was the case. Same with IG-Farben and Rockefeller...

--
mattlambrecht1 (in reply to tanzalone1 1 year ago):
Basically I think I should've premised what I was saying with my opinion that the important establishment is not who you think it is.. The peons in the senate and congress are not that relevant other than to what extent do they stand up for us against people like Kissinger, Breszezinski (sp), Rockefeller, and beyond them, the House of Windsor (Bush family﻿ tree), Juan Carlos and going back even further to the Venetians, Guelphs etc. Basically look up the "Black Nobility" n you'll see

and btw the mention of those very old bloodlines was meant to explain in short youtube crammed words that the motivations and ideologies of the elite are﻿ very old and about money and power and so it is incorrect to characterize the interests of the "New World Order" as partisan or political although very extreme partisan ideologies are used in order to create problems to which they offer increasingly exploitative and authoritarian solutions.Their motivation is probably more religious

than anything else.. As you can see in the thinly veiled origin of Nazism, which is occultism. My point is not to be on a masonic witch hunt either by the way or to promote any kind of religious or﻿ metaphysical agenda.. The point is that old money and power is still around, and American freedom is somethiing extremely new and is not something that the serious leaders of the world really give a shit about. And that's something I find threatening though shooting people would hurt the cause nothelp

Hey, i was also wondering, do you know Jesse Woodrow? You are in Texas, and he was﻿ in texas before he started acting weird. Jesse Woodrow had a News Ministry that talked about the NWO. He seemed like a really true christian, not some fake like Alex Jones. Then one day, he stops making videos, gets rid of all his christian and NWO videos, and announces he is going into acting. But ever since he went into acting, he won't show his face in a video. Really weird, eh?

qpwillie (in reply to florathewiseful 1 year ago):
I agree that he's not speaking in "riddles" but I think he probably fancies himself very intelligent.

that's what I said tell me the difference between the two ideologies they both prevent ppl from being free ... and he burned the american flag both nazi and communist as we know hate that flag ... he had his political view as well as the Tea Party has and many in the Tea Party are if﻿ not nazi very similar ... for sure Tea Party is not responsible but those who praise violence and hate are the only thing is destabilize the system create a crise.

YES. I will tell you as part of the "youth" you are dead on correct. No so-called "conspiracy theorist" is like Jared Loughner.. He didn't even talk about the real issues in his videos, just babbled about shit that sounds vaguely related to it. "I'm designing a New﻿ Currency" is not the same as saying the establishment is working on creating a global currency, which is perfectly legitimate issue that should be raised and needs awareness.Same thing with actual mind control such as MK

--
LiquidSmooth (in reply to mattlambrecht1 1 year ago):
I agree he did babble a bit. It seemed like he tried to use circular reasoning to validate his arguements.

Brainwashing used with circular reasoning, and then you condition people to think and respond a certain way.

--
mattlambrecht1 (in reply to LiquidSmooth 1 year ago):
Idk I don't really think he showed anything... His babbling strikes me as entirely incoherent. Like the sentences don't connect for me I don't really even get what he was trying to say.. Maybe I'm just not reading it right.. But I mean they tried to portray him as a "conspiracy theorist" yet he doesn't mention any actual mind control, just that religion is﻿ mind control and somehow that makes him the "mind-controller"? wtf?

The things they did with pictures of Bush didn't imply anything but direct violence either. Just as the picture with a gun pointed at Sarah Palin's head that circulated all over the internet.
On the other hand, Sarah's "crosshairs" was clearly metaphoric. in fact, it has been used in the past for the same purpose. ....by both Democrats and Republicans.
All that said, this Arizona incident is not the fault of the tea party, Republicans, Sarah Palin,﻿ liberals or......

--
HaIoedG (in reply to florathewiseful 1 year ago):
I think it boils down to the point that he was a person that took the worst of all extremist views and made that his own twisted reality.

florathewiseful (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
Nazism ended after WWII Tea Party as Lega Nord in Italy as many other political parties﻿ are something different they still don't kill ppl but what they praise might imply some stupid buys a weapon and shoots ... we all must calm down and as Catherine Taylor the 9 yrs old girl born on 9/11/01 who's been killed in Tucson dreamed to put everybody together and help this country to rise up again ... with the Star and Stripes flag honoured and not burned!

--
florathewiseful (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):

Loughner was a believer of numerous conspiracy theories such as that the United States Government was responsible for the September 11 attacks, a New World Order﻿ would bring upon a one world currency, there would be a 2012 apocalypse, and the government was using mind control to brainwash people by controlling grammar.

--
florathewiseful (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
Reports appearing after the shooting noted similarities between the statements made by Loughner, concerning grammar and mind control, and the views of conspiracy theorist David Wynn Miller.Miller himself stated “I expect he’s been on my website... He’s just repeating things I’ve had up on my site the past 11 years.﻿ ... So easy to copy and paste ...

--
HaIoedG (in reply to florathewiseful 1 year ago):
....and? None of that disputes the fact that HE was the one that shot those people HE was the one held down by citizens on the scene until police arrived. The fact that Oswald﻿ was arrested hours later opened the door for conspiracy nuts to claim there was a second shooter.

--
florathewiseful (in reply to HaIoedG 1 year ago):
... true Oswald was arrested hours later because he shoot from a building this guy﻿ was easily taken down BUT there are too many things that make ppl doubt of him having done this just because.
His statements are published on the internet by David Wynn Miller, there's a little hole in all crimes and I'm sure police this time will find out :)

Bakuninite (in reply to manuelmontjr 1 year ago):
I totally get what your saying. You remember the Red Lake Massacre in 04? That guy left tonnes of weird (yet quite reminiscent) stuff all over the internet. In a weird roundabout way, I am glad that Jared is still alive. usually these people do themselves in at the scene and are therefore unavailable for psychological analysis. Im sure that was Jared's plan, but thankfully he will at least provide some insight of this mentality from﻿ an after-the-fact perspective.

--
Bakuninite (in reply to Bakuninite 1 year ago):
What Im getting at is that it is rare to get these people alive. Had the massacre not taken place, whatever jareds handle was would just be another weird flamer on youtube among countless others. A slim minority of people that show these signs end up doing something as horrible as what happened Saturday. Hopefully Jared will provide insight as to what separates that freakish, violent kid at﻿ high school from that freakish, violent kid at high school with a gun...

I took a good long shit, which gave﻿ me time to analyze this matter. This kid is faking severe mental illness, as a cover for his premeditated political assassination.
This video is obviously a rehearsed event, it should have been a web cam rant. He used and leveled a chest height tripod, gathered props, scouted the location, acted, directed, and so on. Not typical of an ill mind.

Arizona does not have that anymore. It's now called Guilty, but insane. He will be locked up for life. I think he is schizophrenic. It starts developing in late teens. If you cut mental health services, as AZ has, this is one result. He could have killed his family members. We don't know about his family background, if he had fetal alcohol syndrome, shaken baby syndrome, etc. In this way, we are all somewhat responsible for preventing such﻿ tragedy.

this really has nothing to do with guns. it has to do with mental illness and people looking over it. he was an obvious psycho, everyone around him knew it. his classmates even said they were sure he was going to bring in﻿ a gun someday. but they just decided to ignore it. now 6 people are dead and our congresswoman's brain is sushi.

She's merely stating that the fear of this incident being used for gun control purposes is a valid concern. Most people agree﻿ with you that guns aren't to blame, but it's something to watch out for.

--
sabymoon (in reply to JakDerrida 1 year ago):
Oh, please. If we had some control over his ammo, then 6 people would not be dead. There are 30,000 gun deaths per year in the U.S. Is this the price we pay for the goddam right to bear arms?

Dude, I'm a Democrat. But that's her legitimate concern.. The same way Ronald Reagan used hyperbolic tales of welfare fraud to cut welfare funding(insteading of cutting welfare fraud).. This incident could also be misused for political purposes. Just ones that you﻿ may agree with or not care about.

--
ihmen (in reply to JakDerrida 1 year ago):
im not talking about a psychiatric evaluation. im saying they should have reported that shit to the police. seriously he would yell stuff like "9/11 was an inside job" and "you're all gonna die in 2012" in the middle of class. no normal person would say that. he ever drew pictures murdering people and gave it to the teacher. and they were like "lets just kick him out of the class and forget about it".﻿ bullshit, they needed to report that to the police so he couldnt get a gun

--
JakDerrida (in reply to ihmen 1 year ago):
I don't think the police will even document something you report that doesn't involve a crime. It not only falls outside their jurisdiction, but also their responsibility. But, like I said, this may need to be changed by carefully studying what happened and how﻿ we can prevent it in the future..
One thing I know for damn sure is that Sarah Palin or Obama did not cause it.. But most people haven't moved past that, yet.

--
ihmen (in reply to JakDerrida 1 year ago):
no, you can report something like that to the police. its called "terroristic threats" to shout things like that in class and draw pictures of you﻿ killing your classmates with "murder fest" as the title. they could have easily reported that and had this guy on the psycho watchlist where he would have been unable to buy a gun.

im sure it was paranoid schizophrenia.. im a psychology major and paranoid schizophrenia basically starts out as a seed in the mind. it looks for things like conspiracy theories and religion to latch onto. according to people who﻿ knew him, he starting going psycho in 11th grade. this was also around the time he started learning about "9/11 truthers" and "2012 prophecy" those conspiracy theories are what fueled his paranoid schizophrenia.

--
JakDerrida (in reply to brets321 1 year ago):
"schizophrenia is caused by physical damage to the brain,﻿ not ideas planted in a mind"
He didn't say "ideas" in the mind.. He merely said it's like﻿ a seed in the mind. I don't think he meant that the ideas were the cause. He's saying that it's more dormant at earlier stages. understand?

--
brets321 (in reply to JakDerrida 1 year ago):
A seed in the mind would be an idea, "seed in the mind" is just more poetic than "idea" is. ﻿ I bet his cellmate planted seeds in his colon and the back of his mouth by now. LOL

--
JakDerrida (in reply to brets321 1 year ago):
"paranoid schizophrenia basically starts out as a seed in the mind."
This is what he said.. I admit that he was confusing by using a seed analogy because it commonly refers to ideas. But﻿ he meant to imply that the illness is in a more dormant stage.. Like he's carrying Schizophrenia, but it still hasn't manifested itself fully.

--
ihmen (in reply to JakDerrida 1 year ago):
yeah thats what im saying. schizophrenia starts out as a small thing. but when schizophrenics are exposed to psycho ideas like "9/11 was an inside job" they﻿ immediately subscribe to those ideas and they start obessing over it and as a result the mentall illness gets worse.

--
JakDerrida (in reply to ihmen 1 year ago):
He just got﻿ REALLY confused because you used to seed analogy..

--
ihmen (in reply to JakDerrida 1 year ago):
wow, sorry i used an analogy of a seed to explain the behavioral growth of a mental illness. he probably watched inception too many times and thought i was saying an idea﻿ can cause schizophrenia. when really i was saying once a person has schizophrenia they find conspiracy theores and/or religion to fuel their delusions.

--
ihmen (in reply to brets321 1 year ago):
it was just an anology when i said seed. thats why i used "basically a seed". as﻿ in it starts out small but grows as the schizophrenic believes more and more delusions. obviously there is a physical part to it, but im talking about the behavioral part.

--
ihmen (in reply to brets321 1 year ago):
no shit, i know schizophrenia is caused by deterioration of the corpus callosum. but what im saying is people with the mental illness tend to latch onto ideas and those ideas become part of the illness. schizophrenia starts out with just being a little paranoid. then when a schizophrenic hears something like "9/11 truth" that idea immediately becomes part of the mentall illness. then they hear more conspiracies and it﻿ gets bigger and bigger until it consumes the entire mind.

He was one of these new trendy marxist communist wannabes. He read mein kampf just to see what his opposition believed in. He was mad because whitey was keeping all the illegals out, keeping blacks from genetic genociding whites and not letting jews take the country. He was also mad that college professors couldn't push their liberal agendas freely. So then he martyred those people so they could get more sympathy and push more guilt on whitey. God damn﻿ marxists!!!!!!

JakDerrida (in reply to poopyscoopy5 1 year ago):
He was likely an introvert and when schizophrenia began to manifest itself (as it does around his age) he became﻿ a walking contradiction (reflected by his admiration for Hitler, Marx, and Ayn Rand).

1. Palin is not responsible for this incident.. Attention was drawn to her for her crosshairs poster targeting the victim being considered insensitive 10﻿ months ago.

If Jared Loughner does have a definable political ideology it is that of a far Left anarchist.

Honestly, it would be far better if Jared Loughner somehow realizes the error of his ways and﻿ decides to atone for his crimes, than if he is unrepentant. I suspect that he is the latter. If he is the latter, he is proven guilty in court, and if he is not found to be "not guilty by reason of insanity," I do not wish him well.

"The only difference is the object of your sadism." - In society, it doesn't work that way. It's hard to get people to like killers.

Not all Atheists are evil, but the inclination for evil is much greater with ardent﻿ Atheists than say ardent Christian believers.
For example, just some of the best examples of evil Atheists are Mao, Stalin, Lenin, Pot, Milsovec, etc.. and some would argue Hitler was also an Atheist at end of his life. The school shooters in columbine were Atheist--they shot a girl because she confessed that she believed in God. Another school shooter in Finland were a shirt that said, "naturl selector"

Matu1 (in reply to zigzagzoo12 1 year ago):
According to your logic, not all christians are evil, but the inclination for evil is much greater with ardent Christians than say ardent Atheists believers.
For example, just some of the best examples of evil christians is the whole religion that spread trough world with crusades.
Yea you can wash your﻿ guilt off by " it was catholic curch" and i can wash it off because they were pshycopathic atheists.
My point is to try to make you think more before you say something stupid.

--
zigzagzoo12 (in reply to Matu1 1 year ago):
you are wrong.
The crusades although more political because they targeted Christians along with non-Christians, pale into comparison﻿ with the astronomical killings of Atheists like Mao, Stalin and Pot.
THERE IS NO COMPARISON!
not to mention the fact that Atheists are generally a fraction--less than 10% of population, yet more died at the hands of Atheists than any other religion, including islamic Terrorism!!!

--
Matu1 (in reply to zigzagzoo12 1 year ago):
Again one who do not love to think things trough before commenting. You think that Mao or fucking stalin killed only religious﻿ people, are you playing stupid or something? Also at that time when crusades happend they did not have gun powder or any weapons that they had in ww1 or 2. So your whole argument just collapsed when you actually use logic and do not think ONLY about things what would support your idea. And stereotyping atheist by some few psychopaths shows your stupidity.

wrong again
People act on the basis of their beliefs or lack there of. Hitler acted upon his beliefs in evolution.

Sir, I hope you realize that theism and evolution are not mutually exclusive. Also, just because a person is an Atheist doesn't necessarily mean they believe in evolution either.

penn919 (in reply to staticenz 1 year ago):
That's not true﻿ in the slightest. I advise that you google the quote or read it on the wikipedia article "Hitler's Religious Views". He associated Atheism with his communist enemies. Here's another quote that should make things much more clear for you:
"" I confess that I will never ally myself with the parties which aim to destroy Christianity."
"We have put an end to denial of God and abuse of religion."
Please, by all means. Research the full context of these quotes.

--
lotsofgametime (in reply to penn919 1 year ago):
Hitler used Christianity like Obama uses it for his political career. Although Hitler made some "Christian" statements in public to try to rally a Christian Nation to his causes, he actually made anti-Christian statements behind the scenes. Like, "one is either a German or a Christian" or "Christianity is a Invention for sick minds" & ""You see, it's been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. ......Why did it have to be Christianity with its﻿ meekness and flabbiness?"

Baloney. By those standards you could deny Mother Theresa's Christianity or even﻿ some of the authors of the Bible. Many prominent Christians have critiqued their own religion...but the fact remains that Hitler professed to be Christian, so he was a Christian. I have no qualms accepting Obama's Christianity either.
It is what it is.

--
lotsofgametime (in reply to penn919 1 year ago):
Hitler was no Christian. Just bz a Politician says he's a "Christian", does not mean, he's﻿ a Christian. Judas Iscariatt was supposedly a follower of Christ, but ended up handing Christ over to his enemies which led to his death----Does that mean he was really a Christian?

And this be our motto: "In God is our trust."
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

The figure could be anyone who has suffered at the hands of the USA. Anyone who has lost their home and family and has nothing to live for but revenge...There is a powerful; well of hate out there, there are many dangers ahead no-one is safe, NO-ONE..

capvid88 (in reply to majorl31 1 year ago):
The problem is that even if the "signs" are there, the police cannot arrest someone for what they think he "might" do, and they probably don't have enough resources or funding to﻿ put every "nut job" they know of or are informed about under continuous surveillance. It's kind of like going to the police and saying, "There's this person who's going to kill me!" to which the response is "Fine. Come back and see us when you're dead." We just never seem to run out of nut jobs like this.

capvid88 (in reply to Griffith181 1 year ago):
I completely agree with you that the ultimate answer is for PARENTS TO START BEING RESPONSIBLE PARENTS AGAIN!! Who better than a parent would be the one to spot the "early warning signs" of anti-social, psychotic behavior in their children and DO something about it? You're right - the police need﻿ help. They need parents who care what the children are doing and saying, and take the responsibility to correct the situation.

The reason he did what he did was because he is OBVIOUSLY a PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIC. He is CRAZY. When you are CRAZY even Donald Duck cartoons can drive you to murder.

Calling someone a "redneck" as an insult isn't limited to Americans. The guy who called me a redneck happens to be Hungarian. Canadians call Americans rednecks all the time as well.
Anyway, yes, a redneck is technically someone who's outside all day and therefore has a tanned neck. But the insult﻿ typically refers to the lack of education that would be expected of such an individual.
I personally don't like the term and never use it.

--
jordanstyler1 (in reply to popcornandporn 1 year ago):
Israel is not a religion, first of all. You also named Christian and Hindu. Those are both religions. I said that religion does not have a monopoly on God, meaning God is not exclusive to religion. I'm not disputing that﻿ religion doesn't cause wars. It does. You say "if there is only one god its allah." Again, yes, each separate, individual religion worships it's single God. We don't need to talk in circles here. There is no SINGLE definition for 'spirituality' either.

Here it is boys the British Empire wanted US natural resources and wanted to tax Americans for everything. We beat them back with ex-British﻿ generals who knew British war tactics.

Nytewhisper13 (in reply to mrcheesemunch 1 year ago):
Look obviously everyone here is ticked about something that was said. (I won't bother looking through the cesspool) Fact is, America won or the US would not exist, claiming you gave it to us is based on the assumption that you would win the hypothetical war had you pursued claim over the US. You have no way of knowing the outcome of a war. There is no﻿ better country, home is where one makes it, and cheers to you for defending your country. But you can't cheat facts.

--
mrcheesemunch (in reply to Nytewhisper13 1 year ago):
Again glorifying your country we let﻿ you have your independance so you didnt really win and yes we would have anihilated you if we actualy used our whole army and the facts still remain that you lost more people than we did. There are plenty of better countries than america

--
Nytewhisper13 (in reply to mrcheesemunch 1 year ago):
You can interpret what you want about me trying to glorify my country, but had you attacked us in full force, you had a very angry neighbor waiting for you to be at your weakest to strike. Not to mention the US already﻿ had back up. I will not disrespect your country as you do ours because It's ridiculous. I would gain no satisfaction from it like many Europeans do. So keep lifting your chin high, gaining satisfaction out of literally nothing. I won't see you in any history books.

--
mrcheesemunch (in reply to Nytewhisper13 1 year ago):

first off this guy IS a nut job, I am left wondering is this a cryptic message he is trying to leave? Is he trying to leave a clue to something he buried behind him? also he did burn the American flag, however I grew up a military brat & he clearly showed this flag was torn & burning is the preferred method of disposing of tattered US flag, not to say he didnt tear it himself, but he stated on his page hes a military recruit and It looks like he wanted to be sure ppl saw it was torn,﻿ just weird.

Everything seems to indicate that this is the 2nd channel that he had(Classitup10 is the first) but I'm disturbed by the prospect that this might be another person who agrees with his﻿ views

VictimOfBoredom (in reply to EldonFonseca 1 year ago):
Well, first off, it's just a video of someone burning the flag, which is pretty vague and doesn't really communicate anything other than criticizing America.
That said, there are plenty of paranoid conspiracy theorists all over YouTube who hold﻿ many of the same general type of views that Jared has.

--
EldonFonseca (in reply to VictimOfBoredom 1 year ago):
I highly doubt it was conspiracy theorists that motivated him to do what he did. The mainstream media needs someone to blame so they're blaming it on conspiracy theorists and the Far Right which is totally illogical considering there are no links. He also has The Communist Manifesto as a favorite book which is Far Left . All of his views﻿ seem impossible to hold logically in one mind. It's also interesting that out of Giffords two subscriptions he was one of them!

--
VictimOfBoredom (in reply to EldonFonseca 1 year ago):
You﻿ seem to be under the impression that conspiracy theorizing is somehow relegated to right. Needless to say, that's not true at all. I didn't just pull the "conspiracy theory" label out of my ass—his own YouTube videos talk about governmental control through monetary and grammatical manipulation.
His views are definitely not inconsistent—they just don't fit the American mainstream left-right political paradigm. Human thought isn't confined to a see-saw.

--
DispossessedEuropean (in reply to VictimOfBoredom 1 year ago):
The term 'conspiracy theory' is ridiculous. As if humans DON'T conspire!!! They start this in kindergarten!!! History is littered with conspiracies. It is a modern thing to label any questioning of the system as 'conspiracy theories' in an effort﻿ to shut up debate and discussion.

now how would i know that?
should i tell you or are you smart enough to tell me where i am?

ChampionMarauder (in reply to StuffAntSee 1 year ago):
You know, honestly never occurred to me to do that,﻿ forgot I was on YouTube (I think my first comment was probably in this thread).
And looks like the answer is that you can not understand. I forgive you.

ChampionMarauder (in reply to StuffAntSee 1 year ago):
A bit testy, forgive me if this is the first thread I've posted in on YouTube.
I forgive you for being Australian, you can not understand what guns mean to﻿ Americans. Guns do not threaten us and they do not threaten our way of life. Our Founding Fathers were very smart men, every word that came from their mouths was deliberate. They know that Americans would be in far greater danger without them, than with them.

You either missed my point, or didn't read my first post. In my second post when I said atheist, it was not meant to attribute any crimes to atheism... though I think it is fair to go there if we are going to attribute crimes to religion. Communism﻿ and Nazism are after all, secular doctrines.

Secularism is﻿ the separation of church and state. It does not glorify religion nor atheism. Indeed there are secularists who are atheist, but there are also secularists who are Christian, Muslim, Hindu, etc.

I think if you read things like the magna-catra and the English rights that﻿ the US constitution is mostly based on you'll find that the right to carry arms is only there to allow the population to overthrow a government.

What do Liberals and Adolf Hitler have in common?There is a disconcerting affinity in the way in which they view ethnic diversity.Yet, owing to the way in which Liberals embrace the idea of ethnic pride, the result is that Liberals have a tendency privilege ethnicity in﻿ a way that veers towards a Hitlerian view of things.Liberals claim to have the morally superior view regarding race than conservatives.

First off, the sup Court has ruled that gun ownership can not be infringed upon by the federal Gov. That's why D.C. had to repeal its anti-gun laws. The STATES have a very limited power to limit gun ownership, but most states only use it when law enforcement yells about it.﻿ Most politicians are scared stiff about anti-gun retoric since Al Gore got mauled in his own home state for bringing it up. There is BIG money in making ppl scared and the republicans are cashing in big time!

THE FAKED DEMONSTRATION OF A HALF-MISSING ARM - I read that Jared had a fascination with 2012, and then I found some videos here on Youtube on the movie APOCALYPTO.

you obviously dont understand. the innocent are the ones who will suffer if guns are banned. do you think our government can possibly find and confiscate every gun in the country and stop the resulting flow of illegal weapons into the country after﻿ they are banned? i love my country, but id dont have that much faith in our government

That's like saying all Muslims are terrorists, which is ridiculous and makes you look like an attention seeking elitist. And yes, Catholics are﻿ Christians. They're just another denomination of the faith that are so well known, people think they are a different religion.
I'm a nondenominational Christian, but I'm getting annoyed at the ignorance people are spouting off. Who cares is Hitler was Christian or not, it's the individual that created nazism, not what god he believed in.

--
amy2x (in reply to AudraDangerDay 1 year ago):
Islam is a terror religion. You must belong to a Luke warm church as mentioned in the Bible. Accepting Catholics as Christians is pathetic. Catholicism is a cult. Do some research on the topic or remain﻿ deceived and ignorant.

@amy2x
Actually, I've been studying religion and their histories. Islam is what a person makes of it, just like Christianity.

Probably gonna get burried...Anyways, the video was posted back in November, but the earliest comments (if, presumably, older ones were not deleted) date back only 1 day ago (when the shootings were announced). We could try to conclude that during the 2 month span the comments were in﻿ fact disabled, no-one could post anything, or the video was set to private. Now someone made something to the settings, either setting the video to public or enabling comments. So who did that?

@HaIoedG, If they want to continue blaming Bush after 4 years in control of congress and two years in WH, then I welcome that--it just makes them﻿ look even more stupid than they are. The funniest thing is that Pelosi said that she was focusing on controlling spending last few years when 4 trillion dollars were added to the national debt!!!

You are sadly mistaken if you believe that﻿ school is a place for indoctrination.

--
justinchadaus9 (in reply to lifestandstillhere 1 year ago):
HUH? You're seriously mistaken if you don't expect school to be a﻿ place of indoctrination. The left OWNS 95% of education in this country. You don't think they teach the kids only what they want them to learn? The left is anti-religious, and anti-morality. You don't think they're going to abuse the power they have. You're must be joking.

--
lifestandstillhere (in reply to justinchadaus9 1 year ago):
Sorry, sir, you are incorrect. First, cite your credible source for the "95%" claim. Secondly, I KNOW they don't teach kids only what they want them to learn (unclear on your meaning there). See, I AM a teacher, and I regularly teach critical thinking skills. Capital "T" truths﻿ are not part of what public education's function. No, we teach little "t" truths--multiplicity, the many, not the so-called "ONE" you speak of, here. And public schools have little power.

--

lifestandstillhere (in reply to justinchadaus9 1 year ago):
I do not care if your entire family are teachers, and there is no need for all caps or rudeness. Most of the time, especially in certain regions of this﻿ country, conservatives wield all of the power in schools and on boards.

Unfortunately, teachers have little choice in what they teach and when they teach it, they have little voice in the face of shouting and rude people like yourself, here.

joepeeler34 (in reply to lifestandstillhere 1 year ago):
It's not intellectualism that Beck is opposed to. It's democratic socialism or the arrogance of economic central planners that he objects. Beck is a fan of free market intellectuals and libertarian philosophers. Why do you assume that all leftists are intellectual? That is just absurd. Leftists frequently attack libertarian and conservative intellectuals (often times ad hominem). Doesn't that﻿ make them anti-intellectual by your standard?

--
lifestandstillhere (in reply to joepeeler34 1 year ago):
The fact that Beck has several, documented, incendiary words to say about public and higher education indicates his anti-intellectual stance. Most of the time, his statements revolve around﻿ his belief that schools should only teach ONE way-his. The fact that you indicate his "fandom" of certain philosophers and not all philosophy is clear indication of his absolute bias and inability to see knowledge of ALL things and an ability to hold opposing views simultaneously.

--
AFXE (in reply to joepeeler34 1 year ago):
Isn't free market just a system that allows the few to dominate the many based upon nothing more then the wealth they have. The wealth being largely accumulated through the exploitation of many others, where they are deprived of a large portion of the labour they put in, so as to benefit a few people. Then this wealth is by and large handed down through families and property,﻿ and only very rarely made within ones lifetime; thus creating domination that spreads through generations

--
AFXE (in reply to joepeeler34 1 year ago):
Isn't the corporation, the inevitable monopolisation of power that occurs in a system based upon the illigitimate form of domination that is naked power, just a buracracy that employs centralised economic planning to benefit an aristocratic elite at the top?

I think you're overreaching with the freedoms and when they must wake up etc.... organized labor built the internet. Organized being﻿ the key word, versus chaos.

--
AFXE (in reply to joepeeler34 1 year ago):
How is this reality for most people any different from the life for most people in the stalinist bueracracy the libertarians and free marketers so love to hate. Isn't the only difference the fact that when you get into your private sphere after work, you can watch many different types of propoganda, rather then just one, and when you can purchase many different colours of clothes, or types of soda, or whatever other material posession you can﻿ name. Is that freedom?

Thing about what you are saying. "people like you put our freedom of speech﻿ in danger" If the Constitution really﻿ protects our rights like it should that never should be said. The Freedoms we have should never be put in danger but they have been. Let him think and say whatever he want the is suppose to be a "free country" but I guess not if we have to hold our mouths and everything that comes out of it has to be politically correct.

My problem with the Catholic Church is their sneaky disgusting coverups and the obvious misdirection of Christianity. Confession for instance is not Christian. Confessing to a priest?

I live in MA where the scandal broke years ago and now Cardinal Law﻿ sits at the foot of the Pope.

The tea party has a history of supporting policies that are bad for the people/planet and good for billionaires.

I believe the very essence of atheism is not having a conscience on﻿ some level, after all believers get their conscience from their belief of God who created all laws of nature. Some are nice but still...

That's not a conscience shithead!!

HearingEveryRhyme (in reply to rachelabombdotcom 1 year ago):
Think about it from our viewpoint, how can you let someone believe that the Earth is flat without debating them. ﻿ Think about Karl Popper's quote on tolerance. The "conscience" of the believer is a dangerous one, as it is allowed to justify any horrific action with the invocation of their god. "Essence of atheism" lol, is being sick of having religious beliefs with no basis in fact being a central part of society. It is dangerous.

--
rachelabombdotcom (in reply to HearingEveryRhyme 1 year ago):
I'm fine with﻿ debate it's the meanness I'm trying to point out. It just seems to me there is no reason to attack people who believe differently that's all. I realize the bible was written well after the Christ and written by men. I still think critically about it myself but I don't think critically about creation and Christ. It's in my heart and obvious to me in every living thing.

i never watch braveheart. i have seen it though. it wasn't what i'd call "historically accurate". if you'd been reading all of my posts on this video you'll have noticed that i'm really not a fan of patriotism, it's the first step in the very short road to nationalism, and that isn't﻿ good for anyone.

RabSimpsonDotCom (in reply to thetunaman 1 year ago):
the powers that be through the media have fucked people's minds, chances are even we're not totally immune and we have our eyes open. we just have to try to remain objective and find a solution, but by my reckoning the longer this is allowed to continue (the brainwashing of the masses) the more difficult it'll be without taking﻿ off and nuking the whole planet from orbit.

--
thetunaman (in reply to RabSimpsonDotCom 1 year ago):
you have an interesting view, though I don't fully agree with you. Your theory sounds way to extreme, here﻿ in the Netherlands the media report things according to facts, even though they do form coverage based on the parts of the facts they need. However, the educated reader knows the difference, and that is the balance. There is no conspiracy in my opinion, though others may of course disagree!

--
RabSimpsonDotCom (in reply to thetunaman 1 year ago):
i'm going to be honest. this really isn't the place for﻿ debate and it's to my detriment that i even attempted it here as i know full well that most people here can't think critically enough to actually do it.
it's good to see there's some people like yourself who're all about the facts, as am i, perhaps i'm a bit too passionate sometimes but hey-ho that's me.
on that note i'm going to leave you to fight the good fight, and i may be back later. all the best :)

it's not a case of forcing people to buy insurance, it's a case of government subsidy through taxes meaning that everybody gets it for the same price. this also means that people with no money can be treated and saved and when these people are earning money and﻿ paying taxes they're making their contribution too.

Obama is the president, he represents his party and the people of his nation, including the people who didn't vote for him. Obama (personally) won't crackdown on this, anyone opposing the tea party will.

Really? You can't figure that out? Do democrats not read sarah palin's book? People who are opposing something and who don't want to sound like a total retard might want to have a firm, backed up opinion why they are against it. He probably read it because he thought he needed to get in the mind of hitler to see his reasoning, also to make it easier to defend himself in a RATIONAL discussion﻿ with real arguments, which most people lack nowadays, you too for questioning why he read it

Reality is something you apparently try to avoid. He wasn't influenced by the Tea Party or Sarah Palin. He did this because Giffords was too conservative for his tastes. Not to mention he's a nut job.

bloggerhater (in reply to ihmen 1 year ago):
No, for an Atheist there are no deities and it is an ANTI-THEISTIC belief system. Agnostic is a lack of a belief in a deity. ﻿

--
ihmen (in reply to bloggerhater 1 year ago):
no, atheism hold the possibility that deities may exist. but lacks belief because theistic claims have not met their burden of proof. atheism never claims that﻿ no gods exist. agnostic isnt a lack of belief in gods, thats called atheism. agnostic is the belief that a god exists but is beyond our comprehension.

Catholic church believes that the pope is the vicar (substitute) of Christ on the earth and that he has universal power over the entire church.

@gluonman Simply because I stated a "liberal American" wouldn't do this doesn't mean a person with a liberal point of view wouldn't be capable of such.

There is God's will and there is Man's will.
God's will is perfect and without error or fault.
Man's will is imperfect and is error and﻿ fault prone.
This shooting is not the will of God, but of the will of Man ... i.e. this was the result of an individual who indeed rejected God (as per his own words) and allowed himself to descend into a psychotic illness.

No, I am not one to say whether he goes to or doesn't go﻿ to Hell? Nada. That is between God and himself.
But you are indeed correct about him possibly living in a "hell" of his own making -or- due to an untreated / undertreated psychiatric condition such as paranoid schizophrenia.
Sad thing is, is that there are MANY more individuals out there like him who are wrestling with these inner demons / thoughts / emotions / etc. that they are unable to escape from on their own.

In actuality, they all need God's mercy. The murdered, the wounded, the families﻿ / friends / loved ones / coworkers / the community / etc. -and- finally, the perpetrator and his family.

thats all i was trying to get. i﻿ have a brother that was diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic 10 years ago. it sucks big time and it changed the way i think about God and life in general. i know why people want him dead. we usually do kill that which we dont understand or consider a threat.

I can empathize with you dude about your brother. Additionally, I can empathize with you on your belief in God being affected as well. Seriously.
But you've got to remember that﻿ we all have burdens to bear in this lifetime. Some have it more difficult than we do, others less.

And oftentimes, those people who assist us when our burdens become too heavy are

either unknown to us, or for that matter, known to us (i.e. family, friends, etc.), but we fail to appreciate their help / assistance because we may feel that it is not to our liking.
You do this.
I do this.

@fishstick0071 I agree with you on what the parents of the 9 year old are asking / feeling / coping with right now.

Bargaining 5. Depression & Sorrow 6. Testing﻿ & Reconstruction 7. Acceptance And yes, we do become stronger when we overcome our personal difficulties (or at least accept them).

Palin's choice of cross-hair icons over a map and using targeted language is disturbing. What is far worse, however, is Jesse Kelly's (Gifford's opponent) political advertisement in the Pima County Republican on 6/20/2010:

However, he may have been trying to ameliorate / lessen the effects of his psychosis by using drugs. Quite probable if he wasn't seeking (or under the care of) a psychiatric health provider's care or treatment.
Very common amongst people who have these conditions who are obstinate about receiving proper treatment. They figure that they can "go it alone" and diagnose / treat themselves better than a doctor / medical professional could.

--
strummergirl19 (in reply to amy2x 1 year ago):
BoyBlue is actually not the shooter. If you look at DailyKos, he posts today - after the shooting. The conservative website that links to this is wrong (they don't even spell Giffords﻿ name correctly), and irresponsible for speculating any connection (as are you without doing the research). If you look at DailyKos, you can look up BoyBlue, whose unfortunate words and timing make him look complicit (not too hard to do). He removed the post itself out of remorse, but has several comments.

Why be mad?? you've never wondered that?

You don't see a lot of blacks going on shooting sprees in the US because﻿ we have way, way more whites than blacks. In Nigeria, you'll see more blacks going on shooting sprees than whites. Pull your head out of your ass.

Last time i checked i wasnt in Nigeria, nor did this happen in Nigeria, but thanks for the Nigeria news update. And dont say because theres more whites in america that means theres gonna be more whites shooting up events rather blacks. It dont matter how many there are.﻿ Whites are known to kidnap, torcher, shoot up innocent people, do all types of crazy sick things.

I don't know. I mean, I KNOW the USA consumes massive amounts of opium-derived medications.﻿ But there are over 7 billion people in the world, and most of the billions are in the Asian/African areas.

amy2x (in reply to zigzagzoo12 1 year ago):
In German, not only the word "Socialism" (Sozialismus) but also the word "Victory" (Sieg) begins with an "S".

You are trying to comparing nazi views to "right wing" views and communist views to "left wing". Only the latter comparison is﻿ correct. "Right wingers" in the US typically believe in god and are patriotic. Nazis and communists share similar roots in their beliefs.

--

while it is quite ironic that you would say..﻿ republicans are motivated by religion.. when they ignore parts about Jesus telling you to spend only what you need.. and give the rest away.. or his advocacy nonviolence.. the only religious motives i can see that republicans use are ones to discriminate against gays.... and Hitler a humanist.... kindof a stretch.. some commies claim to be humanists.. but thats a stretch too.

--

Swastika -- used by the Red Army in its early days. It was worn as a shoulder patch by some Soviet troops. The Swastika too was a socialist symbol long before Hitler became influential. Prewar socialists (including some American socialists) used it on the grounds that it has two﻿ arms representing two entwined letters "S" (for "Socialist"). So even Hitler's symbolism was Leftist.

not literacy, but mind﻿ control comes from the language, whoever controls the language controls the mind, meaning both the beliefs and the religion; so everything is controlled from whoever controls the language. so he wants to invent a new language to prevent mind control. the statements of logic were rambling, some correct some not. The listener is warned. Then he rambles about college/military, embarrassed and resentful. Says he is dreaming but awake, that is not safe t

However, when liberals do things that are suspect, they weren't being literal at all and you are a stupid one for even suggesting so.

He probably wasn't a progressive or conservative, I mean if you watch his videos it seems like he's obsessed with literacy. He probably lists it because of its ideals of equality.

naval8viator (in reply to DarthRidiculous1 1 year ago):
Some of the statements make "mild" sense: "If you protest the government then there's a﻿ new government from protesting. There's not a new government from protesting."
If we assume that by protesting the government a new government should arise by act of the protest, then, because we still have the "same government", there is no actual protest. Logically, if a != b, then a = false.
He tried to kill the Congresswomen, perhaps that was his definition of protest--actual change.

Not to mention that he has the Communist Manifesto as one of his favorite books.
The guy was off his rocker. He killed a conservative judge and critically injured a democrat politician.
Even if he winds up being a deranged "right winger" it doesn't mean he supported republicans in any shape. Extreme right wingers tend to be libertarian or even anarchists. Extreme right wingers despise the republican party and have little﻿ to do with it.
Extreme lefties are all over the dem. party.

extreme right wingers are associated with fascism.. or violent militant action... look at his channel.. its safe to say that he is an idiot... not to mention. extreme liberals are with the green party or socialist party..﻿
he killed a republican and injured a democrat.. its safe to say hes not either.. my comment wasnt meant to suggest that he was a republican.. it was to suggest that he was not a democrat..
Its most likely that he has mental health issues

--
satancouldkillyounow (in reply to jjohn211 1 year ago):
It is hard to shoehorn everyone into a left/right category. Extreme right wingers are usually anti-government anarchists, not fascist.
Some rabid left wingers are gun-loving wackos as much as the ones on the right. But then you have the bleeding heart idiots who cry for a tree cut down in the woods and abhor guns or any other weapon for that matter.
You are right about this guy: He is﻿ a lunatic and I believe he was motivated by being a general wacko, not a political party.

He also says that one of his favorite books is "The Communist﻿ Manifesto"... so what's your point?

--
hsbmom (in reply to dennisrecordings 1 year ago):
His favorite book Communist Manifesto, his hatred of the Bible, love of flag burning, make him extremely communist, probably even anarchist. That he loves the book of the National Socialist Party chairman of Germany, Mein Kampf by Adolph Hitler, means he's probably socialist as well as communist. A socialist, communist﻿ anarchist. How much more "progressive" can you get?

Don't confuse national socialism with socialism or communism. NS combines the idiocies of extreme right-wing and left-wing into one idiology. It seems to me that the guy fiercely hated﻿ government. It's obvious where that negative sentiment came from.

Jared Lee Loughner is anti-God, anti-Constitution, anti-American flag, and he is pro-Communist Manifesto/pro Mein Kampf... none of the Conservatives you are trying to slander have any of these things in common.﻿ Shame on you.

Eterna1Soldier (in reply to MentosMan727 1 year ago):
It's a fact that places that have more gun owners are safe. Pure, undeniable fact. The places with gun controls - like Detroit and Oakland - are the most violent places in America. In Britain - gun crimes rose over 50% after the hand gun ban. Gun control laws only make it harder for citizens to protect themselves - while criminals can rain free knowing they won't get shot if﻿ they rob someone.
So yes - NRA forever.

While I cannot nor﻿ do not condone Jared's actions, I do see how people feel helpless against a government that is corrupted utterly to the core. I always find it amazing that the news media's first assessment is that the person is anti-government. Just last year, Americans were mocked and ridiculed by our government over concern for the unholy thing that is Obama care. Americans are having mosques shoved down their throat by an islamic sympathizer president. Hmmmm....

You can thank conservatives for pointing﻿ out the fact that Obamacare was originally penned by those very insurance companies... to the point that Obama apologized and said he was unaware.

Agreed. This is a political strawman of the highest order. Who were the third and fourth targets hit in the gun﻿ fire?

I smell a grassy knoll coming up in this real fast. And the shooting will be a stretcher for the Emergency Room bill to be pushed through lawmaker's doors in a few days.

--
axenome (in reply to kepler1000 1 year ago):
His reading list is interesting- also a bit alarming to me as the books he's listed are actually good for the most part, with a few inflamatory ones thrown in such as Mein Kampf- most famously known for its author- as well as the Communist Manifesto which contains in its very﻿ title a Cold War buzzword. This looks to me like a smokescreen to hide a political assassination. The image being portrayed here is of a man who got lost in fantasy and political diatribe.

if the courts were fool-proof i'd be right with you. but they're not, and over the years i have absolutely no doubt in my mind that some of the people who've been executed were innocent of the crimes they were tried for. judges and juries (especially juries) are not infallible, in fact they're far from it. so if there's a chance a person is innocent, i'm against the death penalty.﻿

I'm not sure, so i'm going﻿ to find out. How about all of you? Were these deaths simply the cause of an alone anarchist, or is there something more? And can we trust our government to tell us anyways? Do your own research, but don't resort to violence unless they do first. Nothing good ever comes of it.

There's no flag in the constitution.
